# rugenere - Vigenère Cipher tool written in Rust


I had extra time, and really wanted to get into rust development, so i challenged myself to start a new project. One of my friends was in the exact
same position and decided to do a simple Caesar's cipher tool. He suggested that i do one for the Vigenère cipher since both of these ciphers are used in
Over The Wire challenges. In fact [Krypton](http://overthewire.org/wargames/krypton/) has challenges that use both of these ciphers, you can check my
walkthrough of Krypton [here](https://bruno-anjos.github.io/posts/krypton/).

I added my project to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) so other people can have an easy deployment experience. The 
[github page](https://github.com/bruno-anjos/rugenere) is also documented and as an extra challenge i deployed a TravisCI pipeline
to check for build errors on each commit.

Overall i believe this project didn't explore ALL of rust's "special" concepts, even though it fulfilled my objective of getting into rust in a more committed way.
